# Sleep, Health and Lifestyle
Explore sleep health through data analysis of sleep apnea &amp; insomnia. Discover how factors like sleep duration, quality, BMI, stress, activity, occupation &amp; gender intersect with these disorders. 

Based on the dataset, several important conclusions can be drawn regarding sleep
disorders, sleep quality, and associated health factors. The two primary sleep 
disorders identified are insomnia and sleep apnea. Individuals suffering from 
insomnia tend to have shorter sleep durations compared to those with sleep 
apnea, with both mean and median sleep durations being lower for insomnia 
sufferers. Additionally, the data shows that individuals without sleep disorders
generally have longer sleep durations and better sleep quality. Among those 
with sleep disorders, individuals with insomnia have a slightly better sleep 
quality than those with sleep apnea, although still lower than those without 
any sleep disorders.

Gender differences also play a role in sleep patterns. Females generally 
experience longer and better quality sleep compared to males, potentially due 
to biological or lifestyle factors. Moreover, males tend to have higher blood 
pressure at elevated heart rates compared to females. When considering weight 
distribution, women have higher rates of overweight, while men are more likely
to fall within the normal BMI range. Increased physical activity is associated 
with lower stress levels and fewer sleep disorders for both genders.

Occupational differences provide further insights. Engineers report the highest 
median sleep duration, while sales representatives have the lowest. Nurses 
exhibit the widest range of sleep duration and the highest rates of physical 
activity, although their sleep patterns are highly variable. Accountants, 
lawyers, and engineers report the highest sleep quality, whereas sales 
representatives have the lowest. Stress levels are highest among nurses and 
doctors, with engineers experiencing the lowest stress. Variations in BMI by 
occupation indicate that nurses, managers, salespersons, scientists, and 
teachers are predominantly overweight, while accountants, doctors, engineers, 
and lawyers generally maintain a normal BMI.

Overall, higher physical activity levels are linked to fewer sleep disorders, 
and individuals aged 30-40 are less likely to have sleep disorders compared to 
other age groups. These findings highlight the complex interplay between 
occupation, physical activity, gender, and sleep health.
